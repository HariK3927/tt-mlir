# Tools

Currently, there are two primary tools that are part of the `ttmlir` project:

- `ttmlir-opt`: The `ttmlir` optimizer driver.  This tool is used to run the `ttmlir` compiler passes on a `.mlir` source files and is central to developing and testing the compiler.
- `ttrt`: This tool is intended to be a swiss army knife for working with flatbuffers generated by the compiler.  Its primary role is to inspect and run flatbuffer files.
